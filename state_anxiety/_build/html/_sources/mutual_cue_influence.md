# Fitting one cue or multiple cues
To address whether we should be fitting one cue at a time (even though they were delivered in an intermixed order) we designed two "mixing models" and compared them to a similar model fitted for each cue separately.

## Models
### Independent fit (fitted all 3 at once)
### Updating mixer
### Value mixer
### Independent fit (fitted separately for each cue)
